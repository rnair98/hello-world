Commencing a decade-long venture through an ever-expanding sea of knowledge. (Skill: Attempts to repurpose a cliche - Check)

Hi Reader,

No I haven't delved quite into The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy yet; nevertheless I attempt to hitch rides from the general sci-fi bandwagon.

My passion to unlock the underpinnings of intelligence was almost inherent. From the early years, I was fascinated by robots and man-made creations that had a mind of its own.
