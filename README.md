# hello-world
Commencing a decade-long venture through an ever-expanding sea of knowledge

Hey,

Considering that this is the first legitimate post I decided to put on Github in 2 years, I'll try to pen a nice, succinct intro.

To come right to it, I'm a self-made jack of all trades, with a vision of somehow combining my interests in computer science (AI),ancient history/philosophy/mysticism, the human brain and intelligence into something worthwhile. No I haven't delved quite into hardcore scifi, nevertheless I follow the general sci-fi sentiment that I can see on the surface.

I'm quite passionate about learning about how neuroscience and computer science can complement each other. From the early years, I was fascinated by robots and man-made creations that had a mind of its own. I'm curious to find out what determines the individuality of the human brain, and how it can be emulated on an artificial system. 
  
In short, I staunchly believe that development of autonomous machines could eventually debunk the ages-old enigma surrounding the human brain.
